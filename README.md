# Start your Rstudio session on Posit Cloud

## For Posit Cloud

[Login with your GitHub account](https://posit.cloud/login), and then [navigate to your Posit workspace](https://posit.cloud/content/yours?sort=name_asc). Click on New Project, and select "New RStudio Project". This will start RStudio and connect you to it through your browser.

# Install FaaSr package and required dependences

## Clone the FaaSr tutorial repo

First let's clone the FaaSr tutorial repo - copy and paste this command in the terminal:

```
system('git clone https://github.com/dekkov/neon4cast_faasr.git')
```

Click on FaaSr-Tutorial folder on the lower right window (Files), then

Select More > Set as Working Directory from the drop down menu.



## Source the script that sets up FaaSr and dependences

Run one of the following commands, depending on your setup (Posit, or local Docker). Fair warning: it will take a few minutes to install all dependences:

### For Posit Cloud:

```
source('posit_setup_script')
```


# Configure Rstudio to use GitHub Token

Within Rstudio, configure the environment to use your GitHub account (replace with your username and email). Input this into the console:

```
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME", user.email = "YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL")
```

Now set your GitHub token as a credential for use with Rstudio - paste your token to the pop-up window that opens with this command pasted into the console:

```
credentials::set_github_pat()
```

# Configure the FaaSr secrets file with your GitHub token

Open the file named faasr_env in the editor. You need to enter your GitHub token here: replace the string "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" with your GitHub token, and save this file. 

The secrets file stores all credentials you use for FaaSr. You will notice that this file has the pre-populated credentials (secret key, access key) to access the Minio "play" bucket.

# Configure the FaaSr JSON simple workflow template with your GitHub username

Open the file tutorial_simple.json and replace the string "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your GitHub username, and save this file.

The JSON file stores the configuration for your workflow. We'll come back to that later.

# Register and invoke the simple workflow with GitHub Actions

Now you're ready for some Action! The steps below will:

* Use the faasr function in the FaaSr library to load the neon_workflow.json and faasr_env in a list called neon4cast_tutorial
* Use the register_workflow() function to create a repository called FaaSr-tutorial in GitHub, and configure the workflow there using GitHub Actions
* Use the invoke_workflow() function to invoke the execution of your workflow

Enter the following commands to your console:

```
neon4cast_tutorial<- faasr(json_path="neon_workflow.json", env="faasr_env")
neon4cast_tutorial$register_workflow()
```

When prompted, select "public" to create a public repository. Now run the workflow:

```
neon4cast_tutorial$invoke_workflow()
```
